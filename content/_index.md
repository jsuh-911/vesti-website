# Vesti is Not Health Insurance. It's a New Financial Model for Health.

The traditional healthcare system is built to profit from sickness. We've built a system that pays you to be healthy. This initial education is crucial for building trust before we guide visitors to the experience tailored for them.

* **We Are Not an Insurance Company.** We are a health-focused financial technology platform that sits on top of your existing company-provided health insurance.
* **We Pay You to Be Healthy.** Our "Health Gig Economy" model means you earn direct cash rewards—**Health Dividends**—for your healthy choices.
* **We Save Companies Money.** The decreased healthcare cost realized from healthy habits creates a real cash surplus in your employer's health budget, which we share.
* **We Use Creative Finance to Drive the Engine.** Our **Wellness-Linked Bond (WLB)** allows us to fund member signing bonuses and makes our model sustainable from day one.
